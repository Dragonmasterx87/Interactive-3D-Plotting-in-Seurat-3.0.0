# Interacive multimodal 3D UMAP plotting of scRNA sequencing datasets
# The following is a length of code generated to create nice 
# 3D UMAP plots of seurat v3.0.0-v3.1.1 objects utilizing the visualization 
# package plot_ly

# R v3.5.3 (x64 bit) and RStudio v1.2.1335 (x64 bit) were used for running this code :)

# Seurat is a multimodal single Cell RNA seq analysis algorithm created by
# The Satija Lab. For more information please see: https://satijalab.org/seurat/

# Updates stemming from Issue #9 Having a fixed scale on axes while selecting particular clusters
# @rtoddler thanks for the suggestions!
# Before you plot, set the ranges of the axis you desire. This set axis range will be 
# present across all clusters, and plotly will not adjust for axis length anymore
# this axis length will persist even when selecting some clusters

# xaxis

  nticks = 4,
  range = c(-10,10) #select range of xaxis
)

# yaxis

  nticks = 4,

# On running this code the HTML output should appear in RStudio. You can save the output as a
# HTML file. Once you have saved, just open the HTML file in any web browser (double click on the html- file
# and if asked select to open with any web browser like google chrome/safari/mozilla/explorer etc).
# It should be have all of the integrated features you saw in the RStudio output file.
